## User guide
* Empirical studies: Estimating phenological mismatch on large spatial scales with empirical data
** Case study 1: Advancement in flowering matches or outpaces spring warming in eastern US
Run script empirical/herbarium/code.R

** Case study 2: Advancement in bird breeding slightly outpaces warming trends in most species in Finland
Run script empirical/bird/code.R

* Simulation experiments: Recovering phenological mismatch with simulated continuous phenology data
Run script simulations/code/workflow.R
